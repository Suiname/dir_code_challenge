# Developer in Residence Code Challenge

Hi there! It looks like you're interested in working at General Assembly! That is awesome. We have a challenge for you! 

## The Problem: Task Management

Everyone has tasks they complete every day. Everyone also stores information in different ways. Maybe you use Evernote but I use Google Drive. Perhaps your instructor uses Github and your partner uses Excel. We'd like to research who uses **x** platform. We would like you to build a survey application that allows *respondents* to fill out data about their **task management & habbits**. 

## Code Challenge

Create a *full stack* application that allows users to fill out the following survey:

* What is your age?
* What is your gender?
* What software do you use to store tasks/items to do?
* Have you used any other software than the above? If so, what?
* What feature(s) do you love about your software?
* What feature(s) do you wish you could have?

## Technical

This coding challenge may be written in Node+Express/Hapi or Ruby+Sinatra/Rails. You must store respondent data in a database (Postgres, MySQL, Firebase, or MongoDB). It should be completely bug free. It does not need to be pretty; it just needs to **work**. We expect no more than 2-3 hours of time on this code challenge. 

## Review

* Your code should be on Github. It should work.
* You should include documentation on setting up a database/project.
* We will walk through and review this code during your interview.
